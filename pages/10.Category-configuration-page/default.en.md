The category page gives you the possibility to create or edit an category. 
A category is a regroupment of playlists and/or apps and/or content. A category can be only created by an admin. It provide the opportunity for the admin to personalize the OLIP homepage for the final user.  <img src="../assets/image-20191113121329857.png" alt="image-20191113121329857" style="zoom:80%;" />

<img src="../assets/image-20191113130555208.png" alt="image-20191113130555208" style="zoom:50%;" />



|                         |                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Label (en) & Label (fr) | Two labels are possible in case the language of the facilitator/admin and the one of the final users are not the same. The two labels are displayed on the homepage to make the title of the categorie understandable by different users. |
| Tags                    | Tags characterise the category. But they are not yet usable. We can imagine in future, developments that make possible to suggest a category in a search result relatively to the tags of the category. Entering few letters, OLIP will show you corresponding tags that are in the thesaurus. If there is no proposition, you can enter the tag you want. |
| Playlists               | A dropdown menu gives you the opportunity to search or to choose one or several playlist(s) you want in your category. |
| Applications            | A dropdown menu gives you the opportunity to search or to choose one or several application(s) you want in your category. |
